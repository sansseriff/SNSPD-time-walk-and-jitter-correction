# SNSPD time walk and jitter correction

This code is paired with the paper titled "Time-walk and jitter correction in SNSPDs at high count rates"

It includes functions for deriving and applying a calibration curve given a suitable dataset.
Generally a single dataset is used to generate a calibration curve, and then the curve is tested on other datasets, for example at other mean photon rates/powers.
